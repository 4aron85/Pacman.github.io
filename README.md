# Pacman.github.io
## Pacman Exercise
We started by creating a button (Add Pacman), that adds another pacman. We store the pacmen in an array, and each time we create a new pacman, we are pushing it on to the end of the array. We created another button (Start Game), that will make the pacmen start moving. The more you push this button the faster the pacmen move.
